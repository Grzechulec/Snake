# Snake

This GitHub project presents an exciting rendition of the classic game Snake implemented in Java. With additional features such as edible fruit, edible frogs (slowly moving), an AI opponent, and a highscore system, this game offers an enhanced and immersive gameplay experience.

The game revolves around controlling a snake to navigate a grid and consume edible fruit and frogs. Edible fruit provides points, while edible frogs present an added challenge due to their slow movement. The objective is to guide the snake to grow in length by consuming these objects without colliding with obstacles or itself.

An intriguing aspect of this game is the inclusion of an AI opponent, adding a competitive element to the gameplay. The AI opponent intelligently navigates the grid, competing with the player for the available edible objects. This introduces strategic gameplay and enhances the overall excitement of the game.

To foster competition and engagement, the game incorporates a highscore system. Players can strive to achieve the highest score and compete with their friends or other players. The highscore feature adds replay value and encourages players to improve their skills to claim the top position on the leaderboard.

The GitHub project provides a comprehensive codebase, implementing the Snake game mechanics, edible fruit, edible frogs, AI opponent, and highscore system in Java. The code is well-documented, allowing for easy understanding and customization.

Whether you want to relive the nostalgia of the classic Snake game or enjoy new features and challenges, this Java Snake Game with edible fruit, edible frogs, AI opponent, and highscore functionality is sure to provide hours of fun and entertainment. Get ready to navigate the grid, grow your snake, outsmart the AI, and achieve the highest score!
